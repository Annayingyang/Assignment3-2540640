                    <h2> Team Section </h2>
                    <p>
                        I designed the team section using circular portraits and concise bios to foster a sense of familiarity and human connection. Circular shapes often imply unity and approachability, which aligns with my intention to make the team appear personable and relatable. This visual layout not only helps visitors learn about the team but also subtly builds trust by showcasing the real people behind the company.  
                    </p>
                    <h2> Video Section with Accompanying Text </h2>
                    <p>
                        I included an introductory video, positioned on the left, accompanied by a short, well-crafted text on the right. This combination was intentional, aiming to cater to both visual and reading preferences. The video serves as a dynamic touchpoint that allows users to grasp the essence of the company visually,

                    <h2> Quote Button </h2>
                    <p>
                        The placement ensures users don’t need to scroll back up, making the experience more seamless and user-friendly.

                    <h1> Wireframes for  Pakages Page </h1>
                    <div class="image-container">

                    </div>
                    <h2> Hero Section </h2>
                    <p>
                        Similar to the to all the other page, I chose a prominent heading here that clearly indicates the page’s focus: showcasing our packages. The navigation in the top-right corner remains consistent, reinforcing a stable, recognizable layout that enhances ease of use. This consistency across pages is critical for users, as it promotes familiarity and reduces cognitive load.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Video Section</h2>
                    <p>
                        The video section here serves as a dynamic introduction to the package options. By showing a video before presenting detailed package descriptions, I’m giving users an opportunity to experience our style and storytelling approach. The video acts as a teaser, drawing users in with visual examples of what they can expect from each package.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Clickable Package & Description</h2>
                    <p>
                        The clickable images for each package are carefully placed to offer users a straightforward way to explore specific services in detail. These images serve as direct entry points, allowing users to explore packages that resonate with them visually. By making them clickable, I am removing extra steps in the navigation process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each package description is positioned next to the image gallery to provide users with further detail. This hierarchy—from visuals to text—was chosen to engage users initially through imagery, then provide supporting information for those who want a deeper understanding of our offerings.
                    </p>

              <!--  Our work page -->

            
              <section id="ourWorkPage" class="content-item">
                <h1>Our Work Wireframes </h1>
                <div class="content-details">

                    </div>
                    <h2>Hero Section:</h2>
                    <p> At the top of the page, I’ve implemented a hero section that shows the heading “OUR WORK” with the studio name “RED POCKET STUDIO.” The large, centered typography and minimal design here create a powerful first impression.
                         This choice is meant to establish professionalism and give users a sense of trust in the studio’s capabilities. 
                         By using a simple, direct heading,I guide users to immediately understand the purpose of the page without overwhelming them with too much information.
                         </p>
                    <h2>Bouncing Icon for Scrolling</h2>
                    <p>
                        Directly under the hero section, there’s a subtle bouncing icon.  I included this as a visual cue to improve engagement, ensuring users don’t miss the content below (suggested by Imaan).  
                    </p>
                    <h2> Picture Cards - Click & Flip Interaction</h2>
                    <p>
                        Directly beneath the hero section, I’ve implemented a clickable, flip-style image gallery. Each picture card is designed to flip when clicked, creating an interactive experience that invites users to engage with the content actively rather than passively. The flip animation provides visual feedback and offers a sense of discovery, encouraging users to explore each element in a playful, yet purposeful way. This approach also breaks away from a static image gallery, adding dynamism to the layout.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Video Section </h2>
                    <p>
                        The video segment is situated towards the bottom of the page, offering an immersive, multimedia experience. By placing this content at the end, I create a hierarchy where images lead to text, which then transitions into video. This progression reflects the user journey — capturing attention with visuals, building trust with descriptive text, and then fully engaging users with motion and sound.
                    </p>

                    <h2> 3D Modal </h2>
                    <p>
                        A 3D model of a digital invitation on a smartphone immediately sets the theme, showing a forward-thinking design that reflects the company’s creativity. 
                        This design choice was meant to provide an immediate visual representation of the product, showcasing the modern and interactive nature of the service. I wanted visitors to understand at a glance that this isn’t just any invitation—it’s a personalized, tech-savvy solution.
                    </p>
                    <h2> API Integration </h2>
                    <p>
                        The decision to add a weather API was based on anticipating user needs beyond just viewing the product. Knowing that weather can impact event planning, I included a feature where users can input their wedding date and instantly receive weather predictions. This not only adds value but also reinforces the idea that this page is thoughtfully designed with the user's overall wedding experience in mind.

                    <h2> clickable Side Menu </h2>
                    <p>
                        The side menu provides direct access to various design categories, which allows users to navigate specific sections based on their interests. Placing it on the left side gives users a consistent frame of reference as they scroll, making it easier to locate and switch between sections.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Content Section </h2>
                    <p>
                        Rather than displaying all information at once, I’ve incorporated "Read More" buttons within each section, allowing users to engage with additional content if they’re interested. The collapsible design is especially useful for mobile and smaller screens, where excessive text can feel overwhelming. The "Read More" buttons therefore balance accessibility with a clean, organized layout, allowing users to control their own information intake.
                    </p>

                    <h2> Essay Cards</h2>
                    <p> 
                        I structured the essay cards to cater to different types of user engagement. Each card includes a brief title, a “Description” button for users who want more context, a “Read Essay” button for immediate access, and a “Download” button for those who need to save the content for later. This design choice reflects my understanding that users may approach content differently—some may want to browse quickly, while others seek in-depth reading. By incorporating these options, I aimed to make the user experience as versatile as possible.
                    </p>
                    <h2> Dot Scroller</h2>
                    <p>
                        The dot scroller underneath the essay cards is an essential part of the design that enhances user interaction and ease of navigation. I implemented this feature to give visitors a clear indication that there is more content available beyond what they initially see on the screen. This subtle but effective design choice encourages users to engage with multiple essays, creating an interactive experience.

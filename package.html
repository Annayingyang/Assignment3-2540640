            <h3>Videography Package</h3>
            <p>Think of us as your personal hype squad, but with cameras. We'll capture every heartfelt vow, every “accidental” cake smash, and every epic dance floor battle that you didn’t know your aunt could throw down at. It's not just a wedding video—it's the highlight reel of your love story, designed to give you goosebumps for years to come.</p>

            <h3>Photography Package</h3>
            <p>Posed pictures are great, but we’re here for the moments you didn’t even know were happening—the sneaky glances, the happy tears, the champagne spills. Our photography style is more "OMG, I can’t believe they caught that!" and less "Look at the camera and smile." We freeze time so you can relive every second of your big day like it’s happening all over again.</p>

            <p>Why choose between photo and video when you can have the best of both worlds? We’ll catch every angle, every giggle, and every “Oh no, did that just happen?” moment. With us, your wedding becomes a blockbuster hit AND a photo album you’ll proudly show off—even when you’ve told the story for the hundredth time.</p>
